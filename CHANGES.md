# Attendee Form and QR Code Generation Changes

This document outlines the changes made to the event registration and attendee management process.

## 1. Attendee Form Response Storage

The event registration process has been updated to ensure that custom form field responses are correctly saved to the `attendee_form_responses` table in the Supabase database.

The `registerAndCreateTicket` server action in `src/lib/actions/tickets.ts` was modified to correctly extract and save the custom form field responses.

## 2. Display Form Responses in Modal

The attendee review modal has been updated to display the stored form responses, allowing organizers to view them.

The `ReviewAttendeeModal` component in `app/dashboard/events/[eventId]/manage/_components/review-attendee-modal.tsx` now displays the form responses.

## 3. Conditional QR Code Generation

The logic for QR code generation has been adjusted to prevent the creation of QR codes for tickets with `pending` or `rejected` statuses. QR codes are now only generated for approved tickets.

The `registerAndCreateTicket` server action in `src/lib/actions/tickets.ts` was modified to only generate a `qr_token` when the ticket status is `approved`.

When an organizer approves a pending ticket, a `qr_token` is now generated for that ticket. This change was made in the `approveAttendeeAction` function in `src/lib/actions/tickets.ts`.
