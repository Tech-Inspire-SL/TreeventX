## 📖 Overview

**TreeventX** is a modern, all-in-one event management platform designed to simplify the process of organizing, promoting, and executing events of any scale.  

It provides organizers with tools to **create events, manage attendees with QR code ticketing, and track analytics**, while offering attendees a seamless **registration and check-in experience**.

---

## ❓ The Problem It Solves

Traditional event management is fragmented — one tool for ticketing, another for promotion, a spreadsheet for attendees, a scanner app for check-ins. This complexity wastes time and distracts from the real goal: creating memorable events.  

**TreeventX solves this by unifying everything into one intuitive platform.**
